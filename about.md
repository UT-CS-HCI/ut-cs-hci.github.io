## What Motivates Us

TBA

## History

Amy Pavel started this research lab in 2021 at the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin.

## Our Values

**People matter.** Teams are more successful when everybody is
happy. We are all human and strive for an inclusive environment. We care about
work-life balance. We celebrate successes and learn from failures.

**Simple but not easy.** We strive to find simple solutions and
principles to solve complex problem. Finding simple solutions doesn't mean
it's easy but it means that the end result is usable and clearly communicated.

**Execution matters.** There are a lot of good ideas but a good
idea only becomes a successful idea when it is well-executed and clearly
communicated. We care about meaningful impact.

**Pragmatism over dogmatism.** Break rules when you have to and
adjust your principles when it doesn't match reality.

**We don't live in a bubble.** Scientists can't be in a bubble.
We have to care about the societal, ecological, and economical impact of our
work. We have to help fight discrimination, climate change, and poverty.

**Process integrity over outcome achievement.** We care about doing things right
and upholding our values. Success comes in many different forms and is
influenced by factors we do not control.
