This class provides a graduate-level introduction to Human Computer Interaction â€” an area that invents and envisions how humans will interact with technology in the future. We will cover seminal work in Human Computer Interaction from psychology to design, learn about the current practice of HCI, and explore modern research in Human Computer Interaction including new interactive technology, design methods, and applications to other fields (e.g., HCI + PL, HCI + ML). This course equips students with the background necessary to perform HCI research and skills to conduct human-centered technology research.

This course is suitable for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students who are interested in HCI research, applying HCI techniques to research in other fields, or learning foundational concepts related to a UI/UX career.  Advanced undergraduate students should take the CS378 HCI course first, but I will grant exceptions for students with relevant research, course, or industry experience. You should be comfortable completing programming projects, but this class does not assume any prior frontend programming experience.
